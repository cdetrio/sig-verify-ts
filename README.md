# sig-verify-ts

Repo with the example of signature verification/pubkey recovery from https://github.com/bitauth/bitcoin-ts.

I had to install this to get rid of a typescript error: `npm install @types/webassembly-js-api@0.0.3`

Run `npm run watch` to compile and `node build/main/index.js` to execute.

Typescript starter boilerplate from https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter.
